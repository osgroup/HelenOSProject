The porting of X11 server to HelenOS project was about ,developing a x11 system to helenOS. The original work was to port X server ,
which includes ,
1)Handling input and output events (mouse handler)
2)Font server ( for adding different fonts)
3)Color server ( for getting different colors) 
4) Xclients ,different applications which use the above 3 and perform certain functions.
We have found that ,the HelenOS has some basic GUI stack which already performs the first 3 functions ie it is already available in HelenOS but the code written in different approach and it deviates from X11.
Hence now ,our work is to use the basic functionalities and develop various X clients . They are having a basic window manager ,which renders GUI to HelenOS .This is again an application .
Also develop certain Xclients like 
Xcalc : develop a simple calculator 
Xclock: display the current system .

Things to be corrected in slides.

slide 2:
The source code of X11.1 version,basic version released in 1991 was used.imake couldnt generate the makefile successfully because , libraries used like ncurses are not yet ported for HelenOS and cross-compiler couldnt compile it .

Slide 5:
Work done till now 
1)Using the available graphics support ,Vlaunch app is modiified to emulate a basic "Desktop" application found in any fully featured OS.
2)Simple Xclient application "xcalc-a calculator " is developed using available widget toolkit.
